In the distance, just in front of the castle you witness movement. 
As you draw nearer it is unmistakable, there appear to be several men patrolling the castle!
Your pace quickens and your heart accelerates, a cool rush of relief fills flows over every part of your body.
As you step closer you begin to notice something is ... off.
With every step the men's skin grows greener, the figure seems more mishapen, and their eyes appear more and more red.
By the time you are no more than twenty feet away there is simply no denying it.
You are standing in front of several giant frogs clad in medeival plate armor standing on two feet.
Even though you haven't been alive for long, it's clear that these creatures are a bizarre sight.
As you nearly come face to face with the group, several dart their giant red eyes towards you.
Some meandering away immediately, others simply staring at you.
Were it not for the freshness of your existence their appearance would be far more humorous.
One of the men in full gear and kettle hat haphazardly tilted on his head approaches you.
