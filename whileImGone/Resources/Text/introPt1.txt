After what feels like a sudden awakening from a deep slumber, the weightlessness is lifted off your chest.
The stillness of being brought into existence is short lived as the free fall commences.
The laws of nature feel sudden and cruel to those experiencing their first few seconds in the material world.
An intense sense of dread spreads through your central nervous system, screaming at you to open your eyes for
the first time.
You comply and are met with an intricate array of colors never experienced flashing by your eyes.
The body can clearly become overloaded, as experiencing all these things for the first time together could make
anyone want to scream.
Before there is any time to process your chest feels an incredible weight again, like an attempt to catch a fragile
and dear object without breaking it.
You are almost still, and with that the violent colors meet your eyes once again as your back makes a hard impact
on a soft but familiar surface. 
The air is knocked clean out of your lungs and the first sense of shock and pain are unwelcome ones.
You spin around to see the surface you've landed on... dirt? 
After some groveling to get to your feet you observe your surroundings. 
A wide plain with rolling hills, and in the distance over the crest of one of these hills the crown of a castle tower
can be seen.
As you round the vegetated monolith the castle comes fully into sight, simple but imposing.
