After what feels like a sudden awakening from a deep slumber, the weightlessness is lifted off your chest.
The stillness of non-existence is gone as the free fall commences.
You can feel, taste, smell, see... things you've never felt before.
An intense sense of dread spreads through your central nervous system, screaming at you to open your eyes for
the first time.
You comply and are met with vivid colors you've never experienced flashing by your eyes at light speed.
Experiencing all these things for the first time together make you want to scream.
Before there is any time to process your chest feels an incredible weight again, like an attempt to catch a fragile
object without breaking it.
You have slowed to almost motionless, but not before your back collides directly with the ground beneath.
The air is knocked clean out of your lungs and the first sense of shock and pain are unwelcome ones.
You spin around to see the surface you've landed on... dirt? 
After some groveling to get to your feet you observe your surroundings. 
A wide plain with rolling hills, and in the distance over the crest of one of these hills the spire of a castle
can be seen.
As you round the hill the castle comes fully into sight, simple but imposing.
